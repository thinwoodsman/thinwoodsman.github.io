>  Smoking pork ribs for barbecue is a process that requires patience and attention to detail. Here is a step-by-step guide to help you achieve delicious, tender, and flavorful smoked pork ribs:
> 
> **Ingredients:**
> - 2 racks of pork ribs (approximately 4-5 lbs)
> - 1/4 cup paprika
> - 2 tablespoons brown sugar
> - 2 tablespoons kosher salt
> - 1 tablespoon black pepper
> - 2 tablespoons garlic powder
> - 1 tablespoon onion powder
> - 2 tablespoons chili powder
> - 2 tablespoons ground cumin
> - 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar
> - 1/4 cup soy sauce
> - 1/4 cup honey
> - 1/4 cup water
> - 1/4 cup apple juice
> - 1/4 cup barbecue sauce (optional)
> 
> **Equipment:**
> - A smoker or a grill with a smoking function
> - A meat thermometer
> - Aluminum foil
> - A large bowl
> - A spoon or a brush
> - A cutting board
> - A sharp knife
> 
> **Steps:**
> 1. **Prepare the Ribs:** Remove the membrane from the underside of the ribs. This is a thin layer of tissue that can make the ribs tough. Use a paper towel to grip the membrane and pull it off.
> 2. **Make the Rub:** In a large bowl, combine the paprika, brown sugar, salt, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, chili powder, and cumin. Mix well until all the ingredients are evenly distributed.
> 3. **Season the Ribs:** Liberally apply the rub to both sides of the ribs, making sure to cover all the meat. Let the ribs sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to penetrate the meat.
> 4. **Prepare the Marinade:** In a separate bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, soy sauce, honey, water, and apple juice. This will be your marinade.
> 5. **Marinate the Ribs:** Place the ribs in a large zip-top bag and pour the marinade over them. Seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or overnight for best results.
> 6. **Prepare the Smoker:** If using a smoker, fill the water pan with water and add wood chips for smoke. Preheat the smoker to 225°F (107°C). If using a grill, preheat it to 225°F (107°C) and add wood chips to the charcoal or gas burner.
> 7. **Smoking the Ribs:** Remove the ribs from the marinade and discard the marinade. Place the ribs on the smoker or grill, bone side down. Cover and smoke for about 3 hours, or until the internal temperature of the ribs reaches 195°F (90°C).
> 8. **Apply the Barbecue Sauce:** About 30 minutes before the ribs are done, brush them with barbecue sauce. This will give the sauce time to caramelize and stick to the ribs.
> 9. **Rest the Ribs:** Once the ribs reach the desired temperature, remove them from the smoker or grill and wrap them in aluminum foil. Let them rest for about 15 minutes. This will allow the juices to redistribute throughout the meat, making it more tender and flavorful.
> 10. **Serve:** Unwrap the ribs and slice them between the bones. Serve with additional barbecue sauce if desired.
> 
> Enjoy your delicious smoked pork ribs!

OK, not horrible! Personally I don't marinate, and instead let the rub sit overnight, but hey we all have our creative tweaks.

Let's try a few random ones:

How is the impulse response of a signal calculated?<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
```
Result:

> 13:26:09.559540
> 
> The impulse response of a system, often denoted as h(t), is a fundamental concept in signal processing and control theory. It characterizes the output of a system when an impulse (a signal that is zero everywhere except at t=0, where it is infinitely high with an integral of one) is applied to its input. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to calculate the impulse response of a linear time-invariant (LTI) system:
> 
> ### 1. Understand the System's Transfer Function
> For continuous-time systems, the transfer function H(s) is often used, where s is a complex frequency variable. For discrete-time systems, the transfer function H(z) is used, where z is a complex frequency variable. The transfer function represents the system's response in the frequency domain.
> 
> ### 2. Apply the Impulse Input
> The impulse input, denoted as δ(t), is a function that is zero for all time except at t=0, where it is infinitely high and has an integral (or sum in discrete-time) of 1.
> 
> ### 3. Calculate the System's Output
> To find the impulse response, you need to calculate the output of the system when the impulse input is applied. This is done by taking the inverse Laplace transform (for continuous-time systems) or the inverse Z-transform (for discrete-time systems) of the product of the system's transfer function and the Laplace (or Z) variable set to 1.
> 
> #### Continuous-Time Systems:
> Given a transfer function H(s), the impulse response h(t) can be found by:
> 
> \[ h(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{H(s)\} \]
> 
> where \(\mathcal{L}^{-1}\) denotes the inverse Laplace transform.
> 
> #### Discrete-Time Systems:
> Given a transfer function H(z), the impulse response h[n] can be found by:
> 
> \[ h[n] = \mathcal{Z}^{-1}\{H(z)\} \]
> 
> where \(\mathcal{Z}^{-1}\) denotes the inverse Z-transform.
> 
> ### 4. Simplify the Result
> The result of the inverse transform will give you the impulse response of the system. This response will typically be expressed in terms of standard functions or series. For example, the impulse response of a simple low-pass filter might be a sine wave, while the impulse response of a discrete-time system might involve a summation of exponentials.
> 
> ### Example: Impulse Response of a First-Order Low-Pass Filter
> For a continuous-time first-order low-pass filter with a transfer function H(s) = 1 / (s + ω_0), where ω_0 is the cutoff frequency, the impulse response h(t) can be found by taking the inverse Laplace transform of H(s):
> 
> \[ h(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{\frac{1}{s + ω_0}\right\} = e^{-ω_0 t}u(t) \]
> 
> where \(u(t)\) is the unit step function. This result indicates that the system's response to an impulse starts at t=0 and decays exponentially with a rate determined by ω_0.
> 
> ### Note:
> - The calculation of the impulse response can be complex for systems with higher-order dynamics or non-standard transfer functions.
> - For digital systems, the Z-transform is used instead of the Laplace transform, and the inverse Z-transform is applied to find the impulse response.
> - The concept of impulse response is also closely related to the system's frequency response, as the Fourier transform of the impulse response gives the frequency response of the system.
> 
> By following these steps, you can calculate the impulse response of a signal for various types of systems, whether they are continuous-time or discrete-time, and whether they are linear or nonlinear. However, it's important to note that the method described here applies specifically to linear time-invariant systems. Nonlinear or time-varying systems require different approaches.

What were the political and historical implications of the Battle of Hastings?<|end|>
<|assistant|>"""
```
Result:
> 13:52:05.484767
> 
> The Battle of Hastings, fought on October 14, 1066, had profound political and historical implications for England and the wider region. Here are some of the key consequences:
> 
> 1. End of Anglo-Saxon Rule: The battle marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England. King Harold II, the last Anglo-Saxon king, was killed in the battle, and his death effectively ended the reign of the Anglo-Saxon kings.
> 2. Norman Conquest: The victory of William, Duke of Normandy, also known as William the Conqueror, led to the Norman Conquest of England. This event significantly changed the course of English history, as the Normans introduced a new ruling class and culture.
> 3. Feudal System: The Normans implemented the feudal system in England, which restructured the English society and governance. Land was granted to Norman nobles in exchange for military service, and the English population was subjected to new laws and taxes.
> 4. Changes in Language and Culture: The Norman Conquest brought significant changes to the English language and culture. French became the language of the court, administration, and the upper classes, while Old English remained the language of the common people. Over time, these two languages merged, giving rise to Middle English.
> 5. Architectural Influence: The Normans introduced Romanesque architecture to England, which can be seen in the construction of castles, cathedrals, and churches. The Tower of London, built by William the Conqueror, is one of the most famous examples of Norman architecture.
> 6. Centralized Government: The Normans established a more centralized government, with the king holding significant power over the nobility. This led to the development of a strong, centralized monarchy that would shape English governance for centuries to come.
> 7. Legal and Administrative Reforms: The Normans introduced various legal and administrative reforms, including the Domesday Book, a comprehensive survey of England's population, land, and resources. This helped the king to effectively tax and govern his new kingdom.
> 8. Impact on the Church: The Norman Conquest also had a significant impact on the Church in England. The Normans replaced many Anglo-Saxon bishops and abbots with Norman clergy, and the Church became more closely tied to the monarchy.
> 9. Influence on European Politics: The Battle of Hastings and the subsequent Norman Conquest had a ripple effect on European politics. The Normans, originally Viking settlers in France, had established a powerful kingdom in Normandy. Their victory in England further solidified their influence in Europe and led to the expansion of their territories.
> 
> In summary, the Battle of Hastings and the Norman Conquest of England had far-reaching political and historical implications, reshaping the English society, governance, language, culture, and its relationship with the Church and the wider world.
