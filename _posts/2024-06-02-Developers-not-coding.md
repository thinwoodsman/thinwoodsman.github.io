Remember TDD, aka "We got rid of QA and made programmers write test suites"?

Or NoSQL, aka "We got rid of DBAs and made progrmmers and sysadmins do database administration"?

And don't forget devops, aka "We got rid of sysadmins and made programmers do systems administration".

Now, to be sure, a particular type of impatient, short-sighted, control-freak programmer is usually behind these movements. The only reason these ideas gain any traction among right-thinking folk is that they tell management what management wants to hear: "we'll give you a reason to reduce headcount".

There are a couple of truisms in human resource management that often get overlooked by those masters of short-term-profit-long-term-bankruptcy thinking, MBAs:


  1. If it ain't a sole person's primary responsibility, it ain't gonna get done


  2. The more responsibilities you give to an employee, the less time they will have for what you originally hired them for


So, you got rid of your non-programmer technical staff, and the programmers took on their work, and now your programmers aren't writing code. Who is surprised by this?

Apparently [https://devclass.com/2024/05/20/interview-developers-spend-too-much-time-not-coding-says-harness-ceo/](this guy). Now, I admit that I used his out-of-context quote as a jumping-off point for a mild rant, but let's face it, the guy sees that programmer are busy doing non-programmer work and his immediate response is "clearly they need more tools!". Dude! It's a human resources problem. Stop throwing future sources of bugs at it.
