After a week of attempting to log in to

 https://entrenchant.blogspot.com/ 

in order to start posting content again, defeat was accepted and a replacement for Google Blogger (once Blogspot) has been found. 


Google has now dropped all pretense that phone numbers are required as a security measure, and are demanding phone numbers just to continue using their services at all. Well, that's their call, and vote with our feet we must.


But this is not a big loss. Time passes, interests change, and most of the old site consists of silly bug fixes and code examples which, while useful for a short period of time, ultimately have no long-term value. Change of pace, change of gears, eh wot?
