> It would appear that the biggest technological innovation since the introduction of the world wide web a generation ago has been productized by a collection of fundamentally unserious people and organizations who appear to have no grasp of what it means to run a software business, nor any desire to implement any of the systems or processes needed to affect that seriousness.

OK, so they're focusing on management in the article, but this pretty much applies to the majority of the developers and self-styled "researchers" working on AI models and tools to manage those models. It's like the lessons from the 30 (even 40? the 70s had made some progress) years of software development prior to 2010 have either been forgotten, or are being willfully ignored.
